How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  
  I interpret user needs and implement them in a program by finding out what the user is trying 
  to accomplish with the program. By finding out what they want to accomplish it allows me to 
  know what steps they program has to perform to accomplish an action the user wants performed.
  User stories are a great help because they add context to a feature that a user wants. It starts
  off by being statement of what they want to happen. Followed by a list of criteria that would make
  feature acceptable if implemented.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 
 When I approach a project like developing code or a program I like to look at the big picture
  before starting. Like what is the purpose or the end goal of how this should work in the end.
  Then I like to break the project into parts that can be worked on. I would like to incorporate 
  the team work and the client interaction in the development process for my future development work.
  I think it is very important to have feedback from team members and the client/customer during
  the development process. This allows for mistakes to be caught more easily and you never know when 
  the customer might change there mind about a feature or want one added.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  
  To be a good team member in software development I think not only do you need to have a 
  good attitude when working because no one likes working with that person who always complains.
  But you need to be transparent with your fellow team members. If youre struggling or ypour not 
  moving as fast as you should on a particular section of code you need to let your team know. We
  all move at different speeds and have strengths and weaknesses. Thats why relying on team members 
  is improtant and for them to also have the confidence when they stuggle with something to be able 
  to come to you also.
